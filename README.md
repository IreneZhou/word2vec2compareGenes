# word2vec2compareGenes
Train word2vec on Pubmed data. Word2vec model converts a word into a vector, so that one can quantify how similar are two words. I then use this model to compare 2 sentences, 2 GO terms, and 2 genes. 

The entire trained model (along with any source code) is here https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzSj4Ecl_7R8T1VJTlhfR09wdlE

This link above also contains a simple Python interface. Please read the Readme.txt in that link. You will need to download all the files in that link into the same folder.
To view the trained model, you must install the Python library "gensim".
